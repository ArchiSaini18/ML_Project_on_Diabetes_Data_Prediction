## 📌 Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic condition that can lead to serious complications if not detected early.

This project provides a real-time clinical-style risk prediction system where users can input patient medical data and instantly receive:

- Risk classification (Diabetic / Non-Diabetic)

- Probability score

- Model confidence level

- Clean, professional medical-themed UI
