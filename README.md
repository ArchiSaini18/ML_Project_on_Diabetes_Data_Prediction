# ML_Project_on_Diabetes_Data_Prediction
Developed a machine learning model to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on medical features such as Pregnancies,glucose level, BMI, blood pressure,age, and insulin levels. Used classification algorithms on the Diabetes dataset to build and evaluate the model.
